# Generate TV Script using an RNN (pytorch)

Overview of the Project:

1. Get the Data. In this case, parts of Scripts from the show Seinfeld are used.
2. Pre-Processing - cretating a vocabulary, vector embeddings, tokenizing, converting to lowercaseetc.
3. Building the RNN. Here, an LSTM cell is used.
4. Training the model on the train dataset.
5. Testing the model.
6. Generate TV script with a few lines of input from the original script.
